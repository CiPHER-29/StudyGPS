# Study GPS

## Overview

Study GPS is a React-based web application designed to help students monitor and optimize their learning progress. The application enables users to track study sessions, manage subjects, and maintain a timer-based approach to learning with the goal of continuous improvement ("1% better than yesterday"). Built as a science project, it features a modern dark theme interface with comprehensive session tracking and analytics capabilities.
